HeapShot
=========

	HeapShot is a profiler to explore live objects in the heap. 

	HeapShot can either explore one snapshot of memory at a
	point, or it can be used to compare the objects between two separate
	points in time.

Enabling HeapShot
=================

	To use HeapShot, you must run the application to be examined
	with the following command line:

		mono --profile=heap-shot MyProgram.exe

	This activates the `heap-shot' profiler for your application.

	HeapShot works by taking snapshots of the heap in your
	application on demand.  There are two tools used to explore
	the heap: heap-shot (a command line tool) and heap-shot-gui (a
	graphical user interface for HeapShot).

Using the GUI for HeapShot
==========================

	Once your program has been started with HeapShot using the
	command line option, you can start up heap-shot-gui, this is a
	program that allows you to explore your application live.

	First click on "Memory Snapshot", and select the process that
	you want to explore from the list of processes.

	This will trigger Mono to take a snapshot of all the live
	objects in your application.

	Once you take the snapshot, select it from the right-side
	list, this will update the Summary view with information about
	the number of objects allocated and the memory consumed:

		Name: outfile_0.omap
		Object count: 1,043
		Total memory: 64,570 bytes

	Click on the tab that says "All Objects" to explore the
	objects that have been created.   

	Here you can quickly inspect:

		The types that are being created.
		Number of instance of the objects created (default sorting)
		Memory used by these instances.
		Average size of these objects.

	There are two possible views:

		* Viewing types and which objects they created.

		* Viewing objects that reference the current type.

	The default mode is to view the types and the object that
	instances of that type have created.  To view the objects that
	keep references to a given type, click on:

		"[ ] Inverse references"

	At the bottom of the screen. 

	For each type show, you can break down the objects that are
	referenced by this particular object at any given time, for
	example, to view the objects that were allocated by
	System.Globalization.CultureInfo click on the triangle next to
	it, and you will get a list of objects that looks like this:

					    Instances | Memory Size | Avg Size
	System.Globalization.CultureInfo            4 |         464 |      116
	   string                                  29 |       1,170 |       40
	   System.Globalization.CompareInfo         2 |          72 |       36
	   System.Globalization.TextInfo            2 |         120 |       60
	   System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo  2 |         352 |      176
	   System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo    1 |         152 |      152

	Double-clicking on a type would open a new tab that allows you
	to explore that type on its own.

	You can also use the "Filter" function at the bottom to limit
	the display of types to a given type name. 

Visualizing Changes
===================

	It is possible to examine which objects were created between
	two snapshots in time.  To do this, snapshot the application
	twice, then set the checkbox on the snapshot that you want to
	use as a reference, and then select the second snapshot.

	The results displayed on the GUI will be only for the
	differences.

Using the Command Line HeapShot
===============================

	To use the command line version of HeapShot, you must first
	get an object map.  This can be done either with the GUI by
	clicking on "Memory Snapshot" or you can send the PROF signal
	to a Mono process that has been started with the
	--profile=heap-shot command line option:

		mono --profile=heap-shot MyProgram.exe

	And on a separate window you type:

		kill -PROF <pid-of-the-process>

	Once you have the file, you can process it with:

		heap-prof outfile_0.omap

	The options are:

		-i 	Show an inverse object dump 

			Show which objects hold references to a given
			type, instead of which objects were created
			by a given type.

		-r	Include roots

		-s OLD  Used to compare objects between two snapshots
			in time.

Comparing changes across time
=============================

	You must get two snapshots in time of your running
	application, and then run the command like this:

		heap-shot /tmp/outfile_1.omap -s /tmp/outfile_0.omap

	This will only show the difference between the two times.

Creating a Mac app bundle
=========================

	Just run "make mac-app"
